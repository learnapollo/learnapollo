# Tutorial 04 - Fragments

Welcome to the 4th exercise in the **React Native Track** of this Apollo Client Tutorial!

## Goal

The **goal** of this exercise is to add some information to the pokemon detail view about the pokemon's trainer:

@TODO : insert screenshot

We will use fragments and learn how they can be used to define data requirements that are co-located with the component requiring that data.

## Introduction

Change to the 4th exercise, install the dependencies and run the Exponent XDE

```sh
cd pokedex-react-native/exercise-04-initial
yarn add graphql-anywhere # or npm install --save graphql-anywhere
yarn install # or npm install
```

## Adding information to the pokemon page

Before we add additional content to our components, let's take a step back. 
Right now, the `PokemonsListScreen` render a `PokemonsList` components that defines a `TrainerQuery`.
This query fetches the pokemon needed to render the `PokemonListItem` component. 
This results in a few disadvantages when we want to make changes later:

* if the data requirements of the `PokemonListItem` component change, we have to go back to the `PokemonsList` and 
add additional fields to the `TrainerQuery`
* if we want to include `PokemonListItem` in a another component, we will have to duplicate the `TrainerQuery`, 
resulting in possible errors when we have to change the query later and forget to update all places it's defined

Therefore it would be great to let the `PokemonListItem` component handle the declaration of its own data requirements. 
Then we could refer to this in the `PokemonsList` component to make sure that we included all required data in the 
`PokemonQuery`. 

This is exactly the way fragments work.

### Defining a pokemon fragment in `PokemonListItem`

To help you get started using fragments, we implemented them already in `PokemonListItem`. 
There, we make use of the package `graphql-tag` to define the `PokemonCardPokemon` 
fragment in `src/components/PokemonCard.js` just before defining the `propTypes`:

```js
export class PokemonListItem extends React.Component {
  static fragments = {
    pokemon: gql`
      fragment PokemonListItemPokemon on Pokemon {
        id
        url
        name
      }
    `
  }
  //....
}
```

The fragment is name `PokemonListItemPokemon`, because it is defined on the `PokemonListItem` component and is a 
fragment for a `Pokemon`. 

Using this naming convention consistently can be helpful when using the fragment elsewhere.

We also replaced the `pokemon` prop declaration in the `propTypes` object by using the new fragment and 
the `propType` function from `graphql-anywhere`:

```js
PokemonListItem.propTypes = {
  pokemon: propType(PokemonListItem.fragments.pokemon).isRequired,
}
```

If the incoming `pokemon` prop is missing or doesn't have a field that is included in the fragment, 
we will see a React Native yellow warning box when using the component.

### Using the PokemonCardPokemon fragment in `PokedexPage`

We updated our `TrainerQuery` with the new `PokemonListItemPokemon` fragment:

```js
const TrainerQuery = gql`
  query {
    Trainer(name: "Tycho") {
      name
      ownedPokemons {
        ...PokemonListItemPokemon
      }
    }
  }
  ${PokemonListItem.fragments.pokemon}
`
```

Note that we select the fragment in the query using the `...` syntax, and that we additionally include the fragment 
after the query with `${PokemonListItem.fragments.pokemon}`.

We can see that the `PokemonsList` component doesn't need to know anything about the `PokemonListItem` fragment, 
other than the fact that it is a fragment on the Pokemon type.

In the same way, go ahead and replace the Trainer 's id and name field by a fragment in the `Title`component.

### Filtering objects with fragments

Right now we are passing the whole `trainer` and for each owned pokemons, the whole `pokemon` object to the `Title` component.

But `Title` does not need the `name` and `url` fields of `ownedPokemons`.

A nice thing we can add is the filtering of the `pokemon` object when passing it as a prop by using the `filter` 
method on the trainer . First, we need to include the `filter` method from `graphql-anywhere`:

Then we can filter on the following fragments that you should define on the `Title` component

```js
  static fragments = {
    trainer: gql`
      fragment TitleTrainer on Trainer {
        id
        name
        ownedPokemons {
          id
        }
      }
    `
  }
```

```js
import { filter } from 'graphql-anywhere'
```

Then we can use it when passing the `trainer` as a prop:

```js
  _renderHeader = (trainer) => (
    <Title 
      trainer={filter(Title.fragments.trainer, this.props.data.Trainer)} 
    />
  );
```

This will make sure that only the required fields of the `pokemon` object get passed to `Title`component. 
If we need additional fields later, for example in `PokemonCard`, we just have to add them in the fragment defined 
in `PokemonCard`.

Check if you got everthing right by openning the XDE and navigating to the detailed view of a pokemon. 

## Recap

Congratulations, you increased the modularity of your components by introducing fragments. 
We learned a lot about fragments, let's do a quick recap:

* **Co-located fragments** help to decouple the declaration of data requirements
* The fragments of the child components can be used to **filter passed props** to only include the required 
fields of the child component
